# DSA-CSharp
Data structures and algorithms to be written in C#.

## Array Max Result
### Given an array select a number that exists, and output the computated "score". The method you create should take in both an array of integers and the integer the user selected.
### Create a Console application that requests 5 numbers between 1-10 from the user. Output the array to the console and ask the user to select a number. After the selection, output the "score" of the number chosen.
